To Run,
Import the db from db folder in your desired DBMS, (Oracle Apache MSSQL, MySQL)

This project was done utilising Xampp with Apache and MySQL, in collaboration with good friend Badrul Amin.

in the db, passwords are encrypted with a hash function, by default all accounts passwords are "123123"

This project was last edited in 2022, and used as a project to better understand and implement php

connection strings are using PDO, some being MySQL and MySQLi,

Future developments include, reorganising, restructurising for consistency and overall readability.
